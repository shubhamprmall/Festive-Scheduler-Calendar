📄 Project Description: Interactive Scheduler Calendar
🔧 Overview
This is a simple yet fully interactive scheduler web application built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the FullCalendar.js library. It provides a clean and user-friendly interface to manage events directly on a calendar.

✨ Key Features
📅 Monthly, Weekly, Daily Views

➕ Add Events by clicking a date

❌ Delete Events with confirmation

🖱️ Drag & Drop Support (enabled via editable: true)

🎨 Responsive and minimal UI with shadow and padding

💾 Events defined inline (can be extended to use localStorage or database)

🧱 Technology Used
HTML5 – For structuring the web page

CSS3 – For layout and styling

JavaScript – For logic and event handling

FullCalendar.js – For rendering the dynamic calendar

📂 How It Works
The calendar is rendered using the FullCalendar class on page load.

Clicking on a date opens a prompt to add a new event.

Clicking on an existing event opens a confirmation box to delete it.

The current day is automatically highlighted.

The toolbar allows navigation (Prev/Next/Today) and view switching (Month/Week/Day).
